# Idea
The first section of Also sprach Zarathustra is selected as the beginning of 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick. It implies the rise of human.
In this audio and visual experiment, I would like to use this song to imply the birth of integrated human. Machine learning predicts a visual protrait of this new form of human.
