# Idea
The first section of Also sprach Zarathustra is selected as the beginning of 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick. It implies the rise of human.
In this audio and visual experiment, I would like to use this song to imply the birth of integrated human. Machine learning predicts a visual protrait of this new form of human.

At the beginning of this film, the Sun, Earth, and Moon appear with this sound. Then audiences will hear this sound when an ape first learns to use a tool, and whrn Bowman is transformed into the Star-Child at the end of the film. It signifies evolutionary transformations, first from ape to man, then from man to Star-Child. **(from wikipedia)** This process is similart to the philosopher Nietzsche's book of the same name which alludes to the relationship of ape to man and man to Superman. **(from wikipedia)**

Is integrated human a kind of new Superman?
